The scripts is organized as follows: 
1. Data preparation is conducted using google earth engine, in which i attach the file in 'data preparation' folder
2. The classification and model optimization is conducted in using Python 3.11.9 while using Jupyter Notebook. I put them in 'Model Learning and Classification' folder
3. The analysis, in which i conducted feature importance and model performance, is located in 'model learning' folder
