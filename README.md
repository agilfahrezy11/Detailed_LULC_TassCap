# Exploring Various Scenarios of Tasseled Cap Transformation Integration for Detailed Land Cover Land Use Classification 

## Overview
This is the scripts for conducted Land Cover Land Use (LULC) Classification using Extreme Gradient Boosing Classifiers. This classification is part of my master's thesis project, which explored the capability of Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT) for detailed LULC mapping. This study is conducted since previous literature has explored the capability of TCT in improving LULC classification accuracy. However, noticeble research gap persist, especially in the detailed nature of the classification. Therefore,  this study conducted the classification while using a detailed classification scheme, namely Indonesia's Official CLassification scheme (SNI 2014). This research is conducted using two different data, namely
Landsat-9 and Rapid Eye, representing medium and high-resolution imagery, respectively.
## Location and Data Source
This study is conducted in Southern Part of Garut Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia. The northern part of the study location contains volcanic landforms, characterized by active and dormant volcanos (Papandayan and Cikuray mountain). The center part of the location is predominantly structural and denudational landforms, indicated by various mountain ranges and hills. The southern part of the location, were flat lowland, with mixed landforms of aeolian, marine, and fluvial landforms. The area of interest (AOI) is shown in the figure below. The red box is bounding the Landsat, while the blue box bounds the Rapid Eye AOI
